# Lock-Free Data Structures

A **C++** library of classic *lock-free* data structures for learning, benchmarking, and experimentation.

---

## Implemented

- **Treiber Stack** â€“ uses `std::shared_ptr` for automatic, exception-safe memory management.

## Roadmap

- **Fomitchev & Ruppert** lock-free linked list  
- **Natarajan & Mittal** lock-free binary search tree  
- **Lock-free self-adjusting** (move-to-front) list
